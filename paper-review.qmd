## Summary

- In Bayesian inference, the **likelihood function** is a key component that connects data to parameter estimates.
- In simple models, likelihoods are available in analytical form, but sometimes not available for complex models. 
- _Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) rejection_ is an algorithm for generating posterior distributions without need to evaluate a likelihood function.
- There is a trade-off: added on computation time.

## Bayes' Theorem


$$ p(\theta | D) = \frac{p(D | \theta) \times p(\theta)}{p(D)}\qquad \textrm{posterior} = \frac{\textrm{likelihood} \times \textrm{prior}}{\textrm{marginal likelihood}}$$

Likelihood: 

- "probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model", or

- "quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters".

## Likelihood

Example: Tossing a fair coin three times and getting two heads

$$p(x = 2 | p_{heads} = 0.5) = 0.5^3 = 0.125$$

```{r}
curve(dbinom(2, size = 3, prob = x), 
      from = 0.0, to = 1.0, 
      xlab = "Probability"
      )

```
